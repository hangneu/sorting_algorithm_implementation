# sorting algorithm implementation
In here I implement divider and conquer algorithm. This code can be ran on either python 2.7 or python 3.5, since I modify length/2 into length//2.

## how to run my code 
```bash
# run python file method
# first input "pythonto get into the python environment"
python
```
after you get into the python script environment using below method
```bash
from merge_sort import divider
divider([1,7,4,2])
[1,2,4,7]
```
